    <meta name="description" content="We propose a novel approach that leverages linguistic patterns and semantic structures to influence CNN outputs. By embedding carefully crafted linguistic cues into the input data, we demonstrate how it is possible to subtly bias the decisions made by CNNs, leading to intentionally incorrect or misleading results. This technique, which we refer to as Language-Induced CNN Distortion (LICD), challenges the conventional notion of neural networks as impartial decision-makers and highlights the vulnerability of CNNs to linguistic manipulation. To assess the impact of LICD, we conduct a series of experiments using popular benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art CNN architectures. Through meticulous manipulation of linguistic features, including syntactic variations, semantic ambiguities, and context-dependent cues, we generate adversarial inputs that induce significant perturbations in the CNN decision-making process. Our findings reveal that even slight modifications in the linguistic content can lead to substantial alterations in CNN outputs, with potential implications for the robustness and reliability of deep learning models.">
